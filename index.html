            <p>The earliest mention of Christmas markets can be traced to medieval Germany, although they likely appeared vastly different from today’s
            sprawling affairs that often feature ice skating rinks and towering Christmas trees. Dresden holds the honor of being the oldest, and its
            main one, Striezelmarkt, offers dozens of vendors, a carousel, Ferris wheel and puppet shows. Other famed markets can be found in Nuremberg,
            Munich and Stuttgart. And while excellent Christmas markets now exist around the world, there’s no place like the original.</p>

            <p>Santa’s worse half is a hairy, devil-like creature called Krampus. Legend has it that while Santa brings toys to “nice” children,
            Krampus’ job is to punish kids on the “naughty” list. Mostly he just frightens the children with his beastly looks, but it’s said
            that he throws particularly bad children into his sack, or chains them up in his basket and carts them off to Hell. People in Austria
            and neighboring countries often dress up as Krampus in early December and wander the streets to scare children.</p>

            <h3 class="smol">Czech Republic</h3>
            <p>Nobody would blame you for not knowing the origin behind Santa Claus (other than the North Pole).
            But he’s also called St. Nick for a reason: The jolly old man is actually based on St. Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek Bishop who protected children, among others.
            St. Nicholas Day is still commonly celebrated across Europe on December 6th, though the traditions vary depending on the country.
            In the Czech Republic, St. Nick dresses like a bishop and is accompanied by both an angel and a devil. Based on St. Nick’s judgment of a child’s behavior,
            the kid either gets a treat from the angel or gets terrorized by the devil. Fun! Public festivities make Prague an excellent base to witness this spectacle,
            with kids dressing as angels and devils.</p>
            <h3 class="smol">Netherlands</h3>
            <p>In a departure, St. Nicholas Day is celebrated on December 5th in the Netherlands, where St. Nick, or Sinterklaas, catches a steamboat from Spain. In preparation, kids leave traditional clogs (or just their regular shoes) by the fireplace or door. (Think of it as the equivalent of hanging stockings over the fireplace.) The shoes are filled with hay or carrots for Sinterklaas’ white horse, in the hopes that small gifts will replace this offering.</p>
